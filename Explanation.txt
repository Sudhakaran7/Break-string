Given two strings: s1 and s2 with the same size, check if some permutation of string s1 can break some permutation of string s2 or vice-versa (in other words s2 can break s1).
A string x can break string y (both of size n) if x[i] >= y[i] (in alphabetical order) for all i between 0 and n-1.

Input Description:
s1 and s2 as strings in a single line.

Output Description:
Print True or False.

Sample Input:
abc xya

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
"ayx" is a permutation of s2="xya" which can break to string "abc" which is a permutation of s1="abc".
